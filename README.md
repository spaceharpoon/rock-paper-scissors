## How it works?

* Creators can visit our website to create a game. A link is generated for users to create a post

* Once the creator posts a game, other users or followers can play the game against the creator

* The creator can reveal the game at any point, and the original post will display the results

## Local Setup

* Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

* Run for local development

```sh
npm run dev
```
